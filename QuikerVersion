This Bp decoder for poalr codes is relatively quick.
I store the indices that are frequently used in decoding process in matrices. Therefore, redundant calculations are avoided.
Besides, the so-called G-matrix early stopping criterion (proposed by Yuan BO) is included.
With above configurations, for P(1024, 512), 10^4 codewords can be encoded/decoded with in 25s on a common PC. 
That is to say, 1.44*10^6 decodings can be done in an hour. This speed is enough for BLER simulations.
